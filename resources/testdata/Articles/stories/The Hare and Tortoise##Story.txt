Once upon a time there was a hare. The hare went to a pool to quench his thirst. The hare saw a slow-moving tortoise over there and mocked at the tortoise. The tortoise felt hurt by the hare's mocking and challenged the hare for a race.

The hare accepted the challenge with a smile. The next morning, The hare and tortoise both met at the starting point and the race began. The hare went far ahead of the tortoise.

The hare felt bored after covering half the distance. The tortoise was far behind the hare. The hare decided to take some rest. So Hare stopped and began eating blades of green grass. The hare was full with eating grass. The hare felt asleep. The hare saw a shady bush and laid down under it.

The tortoise constantly moved along at his slow pace. The tortoise overtook the sleeping hare. The tortoise reached the destination point and won the race.

When the hare awoke, it was fairly late. The hare feared that the tortoise might have passed by him. The hare ran at a break-neck speed to reach destination. The hare was was highly disappointed to find his rival already there as a winner.


The moral of the story is  "Slow and steady, wins the race."
