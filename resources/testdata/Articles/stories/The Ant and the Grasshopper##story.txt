It was a summer. The Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content.  A group of ants were walking pass the grasshopper. The group of ants were grunting as they struggled to carry plump kernels of corn.
"Where are you going with those heavy things?" asked the grasshopper.
The first ant did not stop. The first ant replied "To our ant hill.  This is the third kernel I've delivered today."
The grasshopper teased the ant. The grasshopper teased the ant for working so hard. 

The ant said that we are working to store food for the winter.  The ant advised grasshopper to store food for the winter.

The grasshopper refused ant saying that winter is far away. The grasshopper sang songs. 
But the ants went on their way and continued their hard work.
The weather soon turned cold.  All the food lying in the field was covered with a thick white blanket of snow. The  grasshopper was unable to dig through the snow.  Soon the grasshopper found itself dying of hunger.
The grasshopper staggered to the ants' hill and saw them handing out corn from the stores they had collected in the summer.  The grasshopper begged them for something to eat.

The ants were surprised. The ants asked grasshopper why didnt you store anything for the winter. The ant asked grasshopper what did you do all along this summer.

The grasshopper complained that he didnt have any time to story any food. The grasshopper said that he was so busy playing music that before he knew summer was just gone.

The ants shook their heads in disgust. The ants turned their backs on the grasshopper and went on with their work.
