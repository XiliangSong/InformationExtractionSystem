Dwarf planets are between Kuiper belt and scattered disc. There are five dwarf planets in the Solar System. Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris are dwarf planets. There are also thousands of very small objects in these areas. Comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust are present in the solar system.
Six of the planets and three of the dwarf planets are orbited by moons. Planetary dust orbits Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
