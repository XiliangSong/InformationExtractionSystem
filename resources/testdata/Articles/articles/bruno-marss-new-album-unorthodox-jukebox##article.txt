If the Brill Building were still the song writing hub it once was, Bruno Mars would be both guarding the entrance and occupying the penthouse suite. Not only is he probably the best pop-oriented traditionalist songwriter of the past five years, but he�s also the one who�s been most successful at preserving that practice in the mainstream. Others are more daring, their songs taking unanticipated left turns or staying in the high-minded conceptual clouds. But no one brings it home quite like Mr. Mars, a model of concision who always knows where the trigger is, and always, always pulls it. 

Take "When I Was Your Man,  from his impressive new second album, "Unorthodox Jukebox" (Atlantic), which follows his excellent debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans,from 2010. This song opens with piano, dark and struck hard, a sad theme being resolved. But then things lighten, and Mr. Mars begins to sing: 

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now, 

Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same. 

When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down, 

"Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name." 

This is succinct writing, a little talky, but extremely conscious of the borders. It could work on the radio. It could work on Broadway. It could work in a jazz club. It could work in any cabaret in town. Mr. Mars builds a sturdy skeleton. 

If the muscles atop it are sometimes too lean, well, that's both Mr. Mars's calling card and his crutch. He has a feathery tone, and while he�s deceptive with his power, he is not a powerhouse. That's why on this album, on songs when he wants to grab attention, he emphasizes a particular style or influence. 

"Locked Out of Heaven" is a vivid carbon copy of "Zenyatt` Mondatta"-era Police, and "Show Me" is a lovers-rock reggae song that recalls UB40 (and is one of the highest-profile pop productions by Supa Dups, who worked on the track) and the Flamingos.

"Treasure" evokes the disco and funk bands of the mid-1970s, while "Money Make Her Smile" is cribbing notes from Michael Jackson's  "Dirty Diana" The finish to "Gorilla" is a heavy-breathing blend of Prince, Corey Glover and gospel. 

The new album flies by quickly  10 songs in 35 minutes  sure of its mission. And its songs, which span lite rock, lite R&B and lite pop, are exceptionally drawn and lush, produced largely by the Smeezingtons, the collective of Mr. Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine. They're helped on several songs by Jeff Bhasker, who has worked with Kanye West and is best known for giving the rock band fun. a pop booster seat that recently resulted in six Grammy nominations. Emile Haynie worked on a few songs too: he�s best known for his work with Lana Del Rey. 

Those combinations make sense: these are some of the most energy-infused but profoundly cosseted songs you're likely to hear all year. They are sturdy cages designed to protect Mr. Mars while attracting onlookers. 

That's because his backbone is still forming. Mr. Mars has a Zelig-like talent for fitting into different sorts of sounds, but not a chameleonic one that lets him change his fundamentals. He got his start writing songs for others and then slowly established himself as a go-to hook singer in an era when hip-hop was becoming decentered, suburbanized and shot through with crisp melodies. He is a sideman made good. 

And also a solo star, even if his songs sometimes suggest ones that might be made by other more emphatic, stylistically unique singers. With that in mind, maybe it's not too soon for a Bruno Mars tribute album, in which other singers give a glimpse of pop songs that could have been. How would "Unorthodox Jukebox" sound if the songs sought out higher ground? 

Herewith, a thought experiment: 

"Young Girls": This song swells something serious, heavy drums pounding as a counterpoint to the ascendant melody. The ambition is undeniable. If it were 1982, this would call for Bono and U2, but in 2012, try Daughtry.
